# Not another platformer, please

![Gameplay Demo](./Repo/level1-gameplay.gif)

## Overview

This repository contains a basic 2D run and gun platformer project developed in Unity. The game features exciting gameplay mechanics and a strong code architecture that can serve as a foundation for any single-player game development. If you're looking to start a new single-player game project, this base provides a solid starting point with all the essential components in place.

## Features

- Smooth and responsive 2D player movement and shooting mechanics.
- Intuitive on-screen controls for an enjoyable gaming experience.
- Keyboard and gamepad dynamic input support.
- Dynamic and interactive 2D level design for challenging gameplay (some day).
- Enemies with advanced AI patterns for engaging combat scenarios (hopefully).
- Modular code architecture designed for easy expansion and customization.

## How to Use this Base

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity (I am using Unity version 2022.3.1f1 or higher required).
3. Explore the existing code, assets, and scenes to understand the structure.
4. Customize the gameplay elements, art, and sound to fit your game concept.
5. Use this base as a starting point to build your own single-player game.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development process, please ensure you have the following installed:
